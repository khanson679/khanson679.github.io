# Kenneth Hanson

## About Me

I'm a PhD student in the [Department of Linguistics][sbling] at Stony Brook University (entered 2020). My research focuses on syntax, computational linguistics, and Japanese linguistics. My advisor is [Thomas Graf][graf].

I received a BA from Michigan State University in 2014, where I majored in linguistics and Japanese, with a minor in computer science. After graduating, I worked for four years as an assistant English teacher in Japan through the [JET Programme][jet]. I've also created some free [Japanese language education materials][jp].

Some other interests of mine include: music (piano, [marimba][], music theory), physics & astronomy, operating systems, typography, cognitive psychology, and European history.
