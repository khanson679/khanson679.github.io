## About Me

I'm a recent graduate from Michigan State, where I majored in [linguistics][] and Japanese, with (a bit more than) a minor in computer science.

From 2014 to 2018, I worked as an assistant English teacher in Kyoto Prefecture in Japan through the [Japan Exchange and Teaching (JET) Programme][jet]. I'm currently applying to PhD programs in linguistics.

In my last couple years at MSU, worked on several [research][] projects and served as vice president of [qUALMS][], our undergraduate linguistics organization. Earlier, I worked as a research assistant for the [MSU Language and Interaction Research Group (LAIR)][lair], and as a teaching assistant for [CSE 232 (Intro Programming II)][cse232].

My hobbies include music (I play the piano and [marimba][]), running and lifting weights, and experimenting with Linux and other tech stuff. I have another website, [JapaneseProfessor.com][jp], where I've written some beginning Japanese lessons and free learning materials (currently dormant).
