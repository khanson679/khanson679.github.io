## About Me

![Headshot](/files/me-crystal-bridges.jpg){: style="float: right; width: 250px; margin-left: 10px"}

I'm a PhD student in the [Department of Linguistics][sbling] at Stony Brook University (entered 2020). My advisor is [Thomas Graf][graf].

I received a BA from Michigan State University in 2014, where I majored in linguistics and Japanese, with a minor in computer science. After graduating, I worked for four years as an assistant English teacher in Japan through the [JET Programme][jet]. I've also created some free [Japanese language education materials][jp].

My research focuses on computational syntax. I use subregular formal languages to understand the formal restrictions on long-distance syntactic phenomena, especially case and agreement. I am also interested in Japanese linguistics.

Some other interests of mine include: music (piano, [marimba][], music theory), physics & astronomy, operating systems, typography, cognitive psychology, and European history.
