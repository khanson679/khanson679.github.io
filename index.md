## About Me

I'm a recent graduate from Michigan State, where I majored in [linguistics][1] and Japanese, with (a bit more than) a minor in computer science.

Currently, I'm working as a assistant English teacher in Kyoto Prefecture in Japan through the [Japan Exchange and Teaching (JET) Programme](http://www.jetprogramme.org/), where I plan to stay for 2-3 years. Afterwards, I plan return to the US to pursue a graduate degree, most likely in linguistics.

In my last couple years at MSU, I was a research assistant for the [MSU Language Acquisition Lab][2] and vice president of [qUALMS][3], our undergraduate linguistics organization. I've also been a research assistant for the [Language and Interaction Research Lab (LAIR)][4], and a teaching assistant for [CSE 232 (Intro Programming II)][5].

In my free time, I like to play the piano and [marimba][6], run and lift weights, and experiment with Linux and other tech stuff. I have another website, [JapaneseProfessor.com][7], where I've written some beginning Japanese lessons and free learning materials (currently dormant, pending a large rewrite). I'm also working on a few other projects, which you can read about on my [Research][8] page.
