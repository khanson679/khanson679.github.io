## About Me

I'm a recent graduate from Michigan State, where I majored in [linguistics][1] and Japanese, with (a bit more than) a minor in computer science.

In August I will be leaving for Japan to work as an English language teaching assistant through the on the [Japan Exchange and Teaching (JET) Programme](http://www.jetprogramme.org/), where I plan to stay for 2-3 years. Afterwards, my intent is to return to the US to go to grad school, probably in linguistics.

In  my last couple years at MSU, I was a research assistant for the [MSU Language Acquisition Lab][2] and vice president of [qUALMS][3], the "q Undergraduate Association for Linguistics at Michigan State". I've also been a research assistant for the [Language and Interaction Research Lab (LAIR)][4], and a teaching assistant for [CSE 232 (Intro Programming II)][5].

In my free time, I play piano and [marimba][6], run and lift weights, and occasionally write Japanese lessons and other free learning materials at [JapaneseProfessor.com][7]. I'm also working on a few other projects, which you can read about on my [Research][8] page.
