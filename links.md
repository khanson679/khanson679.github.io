## Other Personal Sites

* [JapaneseProfessor.com][7] -- beginning Japanese lessons and other resources


## LaTeX

* [LaTeX Previewer][22] -- enter LaTeX code into a web form, run it, and download the result
* [ShareLaTeX][23] -- online editor, previewer, and project manager with collaborative editing


## Linguistics

* [Online IPA Character Picker][24] -- point and click character/diacritic selection, then copy and paste into your document
* [IPA Character Map for Windows][25] -- an on-screen keyboard like the above, but downloadable
* [phpSyntaxTree][26] -- simple online tree drawer (converts bracketed trees to images)
* [Phonetic Keyboard for Windows][27] -- temporarily switch your keyboard to IPA input mode
    * By default, the keyboard is installed for the language "English (United Kingdom)", but you can remove the extra language in the Control Panel, and add the keyboard to "English (United States)". Then, simply press CTRL+SHIFT to change keyboards.
    * The on-screen keyboard (in Accessories) will also change along with your physical keyboard, largely duplicating the functionality of the above online and downloadable keyboards.
