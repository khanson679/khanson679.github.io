## Linguistics

* [jsSyntaxTree](https://ironcreek.net/syntaxtree/) -- simple online tree drawer (converts bracketed trees to images)
* [Online IPA Character Picker](https://r12a.github.io/pickers/ipa/) -- point and click character/diacritic selection, then copy and paste into your document
* [Phonetic Keyboard for Windows](https://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/resource/phonetics/) -- temporarily switch your keyboard to IPA input mode
    * By default, the keyboard is installed for the language "English (United Kingdom)", but you can remove the extra language in the Control Panel, and add the keyboard to "English (United States)". Then, simply press CTRL+SHIFT to change keyboards.
    * The on-screen keyboard (in Accessories) will also change along with your physical keyboard, largely duplicating the functionality of the above online and downloadable keyboards.
