<h1>FAQs</h1>
<p>Why do I have to learn C++ anyway?
</p><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><p>Plenty of reasons.</p></div>
<ol>
  <li>It's a high-level language, but close enough to the hardware that we
can use it to study how data structures are stored in memory.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Tons of people use it, and its precessor, C, too. Both are in
general use in a range of areas, so you can't go wrong by learning
one (or both).<br>
  </li>
  <li>It's easy to move from C++ to C, or to a higher level language like Java, C#, or Objective C.</li>
  <li>Because you can't use Python for everything. It's an amazing
language, but it's slow and just not designed for operating systems,
device drivers, etc.<br>
 </li>
</ol>
