    <h1 class="western">Course Advice</h1>
    <h2>Course Content</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Don't skip lecture. Everything you need to know is covered in
          lecture, and everything covered in lecture will be on the
          exams. Bring a laptop and work on your projects if you think
          you know it all.</li>
  <li>
    You
may or may not need to read the textbook in detail. At a
minimum, you should skim each assigned section after the corresponding
lecture. If you find the the lectures alone are inadequate, then you
should definitely read the textbook in detail for the alternate
presentation.
  </li>
  <li>Come talk to us if you're interested in the more advanced topics
that are hinted at, but not emphasized in this course (including C++
features, data structures, compilation, OSes and architectures, etc.).
At the very least, we can give you some recommended reading.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>

    
</ul>

    <h2>Programming<br>
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Start the programming projects early! If you run
          into any problems, you want them to occur well before the
          night the
          project is due. The course staff is willing and able to help
          you, but
          if you don't start until the last minute, there won't be be
          enough time
          for us to get back to you.</li>
  <li>Don't underestimate how long the projects will take. The first
few should be easy, but the later ones are significantly more complex.<br>
  </li>

      <li>
        Test your code thoroughly. Writing the first version is only
          a quarter of the battle, if that.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Learn good <a href="software_dev_pointers.html">software
            development strategies</a>.</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Code Organization</h2>
<ul>
<li>
  Keep your files organized. I recommend you keep all of your
        files for CSE 232 in one folder, with sub-folders for each lab
        and project.
</li><li>
  Keep multiple versions of your programs (each in a different folder) in case you need to go back to an earlier one.<span style="font-style: italic;"></span> Create a new branch whenever things are mostly working and you're about to make a large change.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>From Python to C++</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Do be on the lookout for similarities and differences between
the languages. For example, "while" loops in C++ and Python are essentially
identical, but "for" loops are completely different.
  </li>
  <li>
    Don't get hung up on the differences. C++ has a much steeper learning
curve than Python, but it's going to be easier since you already know
(at least) one language, and most programming languages (so-called "imperative languages") are very
similar in their basic structure and function.
  </li>
  <li>Don't "write it in Python first", or cling to any similar
crutches. Outlining your algorithms is never a bad idea, but do it in
pseudocode (even more like English than Python).<br>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Exams<br>
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Do the practice exams. They are all but identical to the real
          thing.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Misc.<br>
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
    Get help sooner rather than later. Everything in this course is cumulative, so falling behind quickly becomes fatal.<br>
