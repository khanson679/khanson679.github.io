    <h2>Project 9 Extra Notes</h2>
    <h3>Bags</h3>
    <p>Another name for a "bag" is a "multiset". It's like a set in that the
      elements are unordered, but unlike a set in that there can be more than
      one of each element. The C++ STL provides both sets and multisets, but we
      will not use them in this class.</p>
    <p>The assignment specifications do not require you to sort the Bag
      internally, so don't bother.</p>
    <h3>Linked Lists</h3>
    <p>The implementation for our Bag is a a singly linked list. You get to
      choose whether to use a dummy node or not. If you do, it's possible for to
      write algorithms that have fewer special cases.</p>
    <h3>Traversing the Chain</h3>
    <p>Almost every function will need to traverse, or iterate through the
      chain. When you iterate, create one or more local pointers. I will call
      these "iterators", not to be confused with the "iterator" classes found in
      the STL.</p>
    <p>When there is only iterator, such as in display(), call it "curr". When
      you need another iterator, call it "prev" or "next" and place it
      accordingly. Usually, the easiest thing to do is start both at the
      beginning of the chain, and move them along the chain together.</p>
    <p>You may also consider using three iterators if it makes things clearer
      inside remove(), but every function can be done using just two. One
      strategy is to use just "prev" and "curr" for traversing, then create
      "next" when you reach your destination.</p>
    <p>Use the name "temp" ONLY to refer a a pointer to a newly allocated node.</p>
    <h3>Relinking</h3>
    <p>Here, you'll be playing around with the "Succ" member variable. Remember
      to check for NULL before trying to access a node's data members.</p>
    <h3>display()</h3>
    <p>We're serious when we say that you need to display all the information
      about the object, excluding the data and frequency of the dummy node (if
      it exists). Make a proper table for the chain. Do this function early and
      use it to help with testing.</p>
    <h3>Testing</h3>
    <p>This project is a little different from data types that we've talked
      about before, since the user does not control the insert location.
      However, YOU know how your functions work, so you should construct the
      driver's insert() and remove operations in such a way that the front,
      back, and middle of the chain will all be tested. If you don't do this,
      don't be surprised when our tests uncover mistakes in your algorithms
      during grading.</p>
    <p>As you test, also consider the problem of whether there are one or more
      instances of a particular element in the Bag. Because of these issues, you
      will need to have enough commentary in the output that the reader will
      will understand what's going on.</p>
    <p>Finally, try not to overuse display() in your output. It's possible to
      organize your tests in such a way that you only need to display once for
      every handful of tests.</p>
