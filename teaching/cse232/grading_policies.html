    <h1>Grading Policies</h1>
    <p> If your program meets the project specifications and follows the coding
      standard, it's unlikely that you will lose more than a couple points for
      random mistakes and oversights. Nonetheless, I know I appreciate hearing
      this kind of stuff up front, so I will try to be explicit as possible
      about how your projects will be scored.</p>
    <p>Much of the information in this document is course-wide policy. I will
      expand on what I think are the most important points, as well as specify
      as clearly as possible what my policies are on some particular problems.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Contents</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="#basics">Scoring Basics</a></li>
      <li><a href="#details">Scoring Details</a></li>

      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2><a name="basics"></a>Scoring Basics</h2>
    Most of the projects in this course will be worth between 30-50 points each,
    totaling to 40% of your course grade. Each project will be scored on the
    following criteria:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Following the <a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/%7Ecse232/General/coding.standard">coding
          standard</a></li>
      <li>A functioning <a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/%7Ecse232/General/intro.make">makefile
          </a> (once we start using them)<br>
      </li>
      <li>Program correctness</li>
      <li>Output formatting (if applicable)<br>
      </li>
      <li>Testing code (if applicable)<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Just writing the code in and of itself does not earn you any points. <b>If
        your code does not compile, or crashes before producing any viable
        output, you can only receive credit for categories (1) and (2).</b> See
      <a href="#broken">Broken Projects</a> for details.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Coding Standard<br>
    </h3>
    <p>Category (1) will be graded by deduction. For each criteria of the coding
      standard that the program fails to meet, I will deduct points until none
      remain for the category. In other words, you can meet several of the
      criteria while receiving a score of 0 if, for example, if your code is
      completely unindented, has no comments, etc.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The coding standard boils down to (a) formatting and (b) documentation.
      These are basic programming skills, and our requirements are not
      complicated, so there is no excuse for not following the coding standard.</p>
    <p>In particular, please use the suggested format for file/function headers
      unless you have an alternative that is equal or superior to ours.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Makefiles<br>
    </h3>
    <p>If your makefile works and follows the course standard, you get full
      credit for category (2). The makefiles for the projects in this course
      will be almost identical, so this one should be a freebie. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Notes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Please include a brief file header with your name and project number
        (otherwise, I can't distinguish between them easily). Use '#' for
        comments in makefiles.</li>
      <li>Please use the specified executable name (always "projectXX") and
        compile your project the way we taught you.</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Program Correctness</h3>
    <p>For full credit in category (3), your program must meet all of the
      project specifications. Within category (3), each specification will be
      graded independently (to the extent that this is possible), so you can
      earn full, partial, or no credit for each specification.</p>
    <p>You need to test your programs thoroughly in order to ensure that they
      produce good output for all normal input. You also need to include error
      handling code to prevent special cases from crashing the program or
      producing garbage output.<br>
      <br>
      See below for the policy on <a href="#partial_credit">partial credit</a>.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Output Formatting<br>
    </h3>
    <p>For category (4), program output must always:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>Follow the project specifications<br>
      </li>
      <li>Display correctly in an 80 character wide terminal</li>
      <li>Be labeled and formatted so that it is:</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>easily readable, and<br>
        </li>
        <li>understandable to a reader who has not seen the source code</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <p>I would like to give special emphasis to the last point. You may know
      what your unlabeled output means, but your user doesn't, and it's not
      their job to figure it out.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Testing Code<br>
    </h3>
    <p>For category (5), testing code (usually a "driver" module) must always:</p>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>Test all functions and logic paths in the main code</li>
      <li>Test all reasonable categories of input</li>
      <ul>
        <li>For example, if you have a function uses the sine of some input
          value, you must test input values from all four quadrants.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Test all typical special cases</li>
      <ul>
        <li>This includes any input that is likely to crash the program or
          produce nonsensical output.</li>
        <li>As you do this, make sure you fix your code to handle any problems
          you find!</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Your testing code should change as you develop your program. Remove any
      unnecessary tests at the end, but leave in enough to prove that you tested
      thoroughly. Comment out any tests that crash the program.</p>
    <h2><a name="details"></a>Scoring Details</h2>
    <h3><a name="partial_credit"></a>Partial Credit</h3>
    There are two kinds of partial credit you can receive for each project
    specification:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Partial credit for components that partially meet project
        specifications</li>
      <li>Partial credit for components that do not the project specifications,
        but would if it weren't for a small programming mistake.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For category (1), points will be assigned based on the degree to which
      the component meets project specifications. Failure to handle special
      cases will lose you fewer points than bad output for more typical input.<br>
    </p>
    <p>For category (2), you must understand that <span style="font-weight: bold;">I
        am not obligated to try to find your mistakes in order to give you
        partial credit for program components that do not work properly.</span>
      That being said, I will usually try to do so for your benefit. Because of
      this, it's in your best interest to make your code as readable as
      possible.</p>
    <p> In general, small problems will result in 0.5 to 1 point deductions, and
      larger problems will result in the loss of a proportion of the total
      points for the category.</p>
    <p>There are two specific situations in which I definitely will <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span>
      search for your mistakes:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>If your testing code is poor or non-existent, or it is otherwise
        obvious that you did not test your code properly</li>
      <li>If your code is poorly formatted and/or poorly documented, making it
        unnecessarily difficult for me to interpret it</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Interdependent Code<br>
    </h3>
    <p>Often, a problem in one component of the program will ruin otherwise
      correct output from other components of the program. Sometimes, the
      effects of this are transparent enough that I can give you full credit for
      the dependent components without any trouble.</p>
    <p>However, when this is not the case, <span style="font-weight: bold;">I
        am not obligated to try to "fix" your code and rerun our tests in order
        to give the the maximum possible score for the dependent components.</span>
      I may choose to do so if I believe it is warranted and easy to do so, but
      it your responsibility to identify the most core components of your
      program and make sure they work.</p>
    <h3><a name="broken"></a>Broken Projects</h3>
    <p>Per course-wide policy, if you turn in code that does not compile, or
      crashes before producing any viable output, you can receive points only
      for the "general requirements" criteria. In other words, you get a zero
      for all project specifications. It is not possible for me to accurately
      grade projects that do not run, so this is non-negotiable.</p>
    <p>In practice, there is no reason for this to ever happen. One of the goals
      of this course is for you to learn proper software development strategy,
      the heart of which is incremental development. Please see <a href="https://www.msu.edu/%7Ehanson54/cse232ss13/software_dev_pointers.html">Software
        Development Pointers</a> for details.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Additional Penalties</h3>
    <p>I may deduct additional points for programs that show truly horrible
      design decisions, for example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Duplicate code</li>
      <li>Failing to break complex code into multiple functions </li>
      <li> Failing to break large programs with multiple distinct components
        into multiple files </li>
      <li> Putting implementation code in header files (except for short inline
        functions)</li>
      <li>#include-ing implementation files </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Freebies</h3>
    Occasionally, I may decide not to deduct points for some particular issue,
    usually when I think something in the instructions was unclear. In this
    case, I will generally write "-0" followed by a comment on the relevant
    section of the affected score sheets.
    <p> </p>
    <h2><a name="feedback"></a>Project Feedback</h2>
    <p>For each project, you will receive a scoresheet with comments via email.
      I take these very seriously, and would appreciate it if you do as well. I
      will give very detailed comments for the first couple projects in in order
      to help you master C++ more quickly.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Scoresheets will usually be returned within one week of the project due
      date, and almost always before the next project. If you believe there is a
      problem with a scoresheet, please email me ASAP. If I made a mistake, I
      will fix it and update your grade.<br>
    </p>
    <h2><a name="disputes"></a>Grade Disputes</h2>
    <p> I try to grade as accurately and consistently as possible, but if you
      believe I have (1) made a mistake, or (2) graded one of your projects
      unfairly <span style="font-weight: bold;">compared to other students in
        this section</span>, I will take another look.</p>
    <p>However, I have no control over how the other TAs grade their students,
      so I will not consider complaints along the line of "so-and-so didn't take
      off points for [insert problem here]". In other words, all grading
      decisions are final for the current project. You can still let me know
      about these kinds of issues, but any changes I make will only affect
      future projects.</p>
    <p>If you believe that grading between the TAs is unequal in general, you
      should inform Mr. McCullen directly.</p>
