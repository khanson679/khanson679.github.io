    <h1>Linux Basics<br>
    </h1>
    <h2>What is Linux?</h2>
    GNU/Linux, or just Linux, is an operating system in the same sense as
    Windows and MacOS X, but its components are less tightly integrated. The
    major components are:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>the Linux kernel (core of the OS)</li>
      <li>the GNU tools (which duplicate the functionality of the Unix operating
        system)</li>
      <li>a graphical interface (optional)</li>
      <li>various individual software packages</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Linux is considered a "Unix-like" operating system, and is similar to
      operating systems like MacOS X, Solaris, and the BSD family, which are
      descended from the original Unix operating system. (Windows and earlier
      version of MacOS are not Unix or Unix-like systems.) When people talk
      about "Unix [insert feature/component here]", as in "Unix shells" or "the
      Unix filesystem", Linux is usually assumed to be included as well.<br>
    </p>
    <p> Like the BSDs but unlike Windows and Mac, Linux is available in a number
      of "distributions", each of which provides a complete system with numerous
      pre-configured software packages. The CSE Linux workstations and several
      of the servers run Debian, the parent of the popular (and more
      user-friendly) Ubuntu distibution.</p>
    <h2>User Accounts</h2>
    <p>All of the CSE Linux workstations, will load your <em>home directory</em>
      when you log in. This directory contains all the files related to your
      user account, including desktop and program settings. The path to this
      directory is always <code>/user/YOUR_NETID</code>. Your Linux directory
      is accessible as a Samba filesystem when you are logged into a Windows
      workstation (open My Computer).</p>
    <p>Your home directory is also loaded when you log into the CSE servers
      remotely. This allows you to work from your home computer without moving
      files around (see <a href="working_remotely.html">Working Remotely</a>).</p>
    <h2>The Linux Terminal<br>
    </h2>
    <p>What is usually called the "command line" or "command prompt" in Windows
      world is usually called a <span style="font-style: italic;">terminal</span>
      in Unix world. Both are <span style="font-style: italic;">command-line
        interfaces</span> in the technical sense, and work by allowing the user
      type in commands to navigate directories, run programs, and so on. Most
      Linux distributions (even those with well developed graphical
      environments) still rely heavily on the terminal for administrative tasks,
      which makes the OS difficult for non-technical users.</p>
    <p>Related to the idea of a terminal is the <span style="font-style: italic;">shell</span>,
      which is the actual program or set of programs which provide a command
      line or graphical interface. CSE computers run the the shell "tcsh" in the
      terminal by default, but it is possible to configure your account to use a
      different shell, such as"bash". The basic functionality of these shells is
      mostly the same, but their scripting features (which make it easy to
      automate various tasks) are not, so <em>tcsh </em>and <em>bash </em>scripts
      are not compatible.</p>
    <h3>Using the Terminal&nbsp;</h3>
    <p>See the <a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/%7Ecse232/Tutorial/">Unix
        Tutorial</a> (part of Lab Assignment 1).<br>

    <h2>Desktop Environments</h2>
    <p>Unlike in Windows and Mac, there are several completely independent
      graphical desktop environments available for Linux, including the fully
      featured <strong>Gnome </strong>and <strong>KDE</strong>, the lighter
      weight <strong>XFCE</strong>, and the very minimal <strong>LXDE</strong>.
      Desktop environments themselves are fairly modular, and in addition to
      basic components like <span style="font-style: italic;">window managers</span>
      and <span style="font-style: italic;">file managers</span>, often provide
      desktop publishing applications, web browsers, and so on.</p>
    <p>The CSE Linux workstations run Gnome 2 by default, but it is possible to
      choose a different desktop environment at login time. You can also run
      programs from one desktop environment within another, though there is a
      performance penalty in doing so since the libraries for both environments
      must be loaded.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Navigating Gnome</h3>
    <p>Gnome 2 should feel fairly familar to Windows and Mac users. Gnome's main
      differentiating features are the dual taskbars and the separate
      Applications/Places/System menus.</p>
    <p>Note that copy and paste in the terminal are <strong>ctrl-shift-c</strong>
      and <strong>ctrl-shift-v</strong> respectively. Elsewhere, shortcuts for
      copy/paste, print, save, etc. are usually like Windows.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Some Linux Equivalents of Windows Programs<br>
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Firefox -&gt; Iceweasel (debranded version of Firefox, used in Debian
        and some other distributions)</li>
      <li>Microsoft Office -&gt; OpenOffice/LibreOffice (also available on
        Windows)<br>
      </li>
      <li>Photoshop -&gt; GIMP (also available on Windows)</li>
      <li>Notepad -&gt; Gedit (Gnome) / Kwrite (KDE)<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Most desktop customization and system administration tools have obvious
      names.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Gnome Tips<br>
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Create toolbar shortcuts for Iceweasel and the terminal by dragging
        from the Applications menu</li>
      <li>Make the terminal easier to read by switching to a dark background<br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Go to Edit -&gt; Profile preferences</li>
        <li>Change "Colors" to "White on Black"</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
