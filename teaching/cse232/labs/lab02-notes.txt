CSE 232 Lab 2 Notes


1. Sizes of Primitive Types

Size of integer data objects (in bytes)

  short:        2
  int:          4
  long:         8

Size of floating point data objects (in bytes)

  float:        4
  double:       8

Size of other data objects (in bytes)

  char:         1
  bool:         1
  void*:        8
  
Note: void* is a pointer to a variable of unspecified type.
all pointers are the same size.
 
 
2. Typecasting
 
For our purposes, the following notations are identical:

	C notation:			(int)x
	function notation:	int(x)
	
You will not enounted any differences in 232.


3. Increment/Decrement

x++ or ++x alone same as "x = x + 1;"
x-- or --x alone same as "x = x - 1;"

But they are different on the right side of assignment.

y = x++;    same as    y = x;
                       x = x + 1;
	
y = ++x;    same as    x = x + 1;
                       y = x;


4. Variable Initialization

int x = 3;    same as    int x;
                         x = 3;
	
It's usually better to use the initialization notation.


5. Variable Name Conventions

I recommend the following conventions, which are used in both C++ and Java.

variables and functions:    someObject, someFunction
class names:                ClassName
constants:                  SOME_CONSTANT

Otherwise, immitate the conventions in the examples and labs.
Try not to mix styles in the same file.
