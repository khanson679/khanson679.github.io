Supplmental materials for a second semester programming class. Beginning programmers might find the C++ examples and Linux guides useful.

## Workshops/Tutorials

A tutorial for drawing trees using software. Starts with manipulation of simple bracketed trees using a text editor and converting them to images with a web-based tree drawing program. The second part introduces the Forest package for drawing fancy trees with LaTeX.

[qUALMS Conlanging Workshop (FS13)](conlanging)<br/>
An attempt at making a system for designing a [conlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language) in a single sitting. We determined that 90 minutes wasn't long enough.
