    <h1>Using a Text Editor</h1>
    <p>Text editors are primarily designed for programming and other work that
      involves raw text files, which lack fonts, bold/italics, alignment, and
      other typographic features. Otherwise, they work much like any other
      graphical content creation program.</p>
    <p>This page assumes you're using <a href="http://jedit.org/index.php">jEdit</a>,
      which works on all operating systems, but most editors will have all of
      the features discussed on this page. I'm not a Mac user, but on Windows, <a
        href="http://notepadplusplus.org/">Notepad++</a> is free and extremely
      good.</p>
    <h2>Super Simple Stuff</h2>
    <h3>Opening and Saving Files</h3>
    <p>Usually, you'll save your files in your user directory (such as "My
      Documents" and the like), so no problem there.However, text files can have
      various extensions, like ".tex" for LaTeX documents, and ".py" for Python
      programs, so double clicking will not necessarily open the file in your
      editor of choice.</p>
    <p>You can set your file associations to have each extention you use open in
      jEdit by default. On Windows, you can also right click and choose "Open
      with jEdit".</p>
    <h3>Text Manipulation</h3>
    <p> You'll find the same "file", "edit", and "view" menus as anywhere else,
      and you can select, cut, copy, and paste text just like usual.</p>
    <h3>Indentation</h3>
    <p>In order to format text files using only ASCII characters, we instead
      rely on intelligent use of whitespace and indentation. Most text editors
      have features that make this easier.</p>
