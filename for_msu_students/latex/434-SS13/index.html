    <h1>LaTeX &amp; Tree Drawing Workshops</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>There are two interrelated goals for these workshops:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>To allow you to draw syntactic trees using a computer</li>
      <li>To allow you to use LaTeX to write about linguistics</li>
    </ol>
    <p>We'll do this in three steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Drawing simple non-LaTeX trees</li>
      <li>Learn to use the "Qtree" LaTeX package to produce trees using an
        online LaTeX previewer (no installation required).</li>
      <li>Learn to write syntax and semantics papers (or even just homework
        assignments) using the website ShareLaTeX (still no installation
        required).</li>
    </ol>
    <h2></h2>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>TeX is a kind of programming language used for typesetting documents.
      LaTeX is essentially a collection of TeX macros that make this
      significantly easier.</p>
    <p>The basic purpose of using LaTeX rather than Microsoft Word or some other
      desktop publishing program is that it fully separates formatting from
      content, making it possible to change the formatting for your document by
      making changes in only one place. And because TeX is a very good
      typesetter, it's much easier to get professional-looking results.</p>
    <p>But the main reason that you really want to learn LaTeX is that it makes
      writing papers in subjects like math, philosophy, and linguistics much
      easier. And in the case of syntax, it also allows you to draw perfect
      trees.</p>
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <h3>Setting Up an Editor</h3>
    <p>LaTeX files are created and modified using a text editor. Bracketed trees
      (even outside of LaTeX) are likewise easiest to produce using an editor.</p>
    <p>There are many good editors out there, but for simplicity, everyone
      should use jEdit, which works on all operating systems (it requires Java).
      You can download the program here:</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="http://jedit.org/index.php?page=download">http://jedit.org/index.php?page=download</a></p>
    <p>Use the Windows or Mac installer, not the Java installer. Uncheck the
      boxes for installing the macro API and starting automatically on system
      startup.</p>
    <h2>Workshops</h2>
    <h3>Workshop 1 (3/1 during LIN 434)</h3>
    Notes:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Bring your own laptop if possible. Install jEdit beforehand as
        described above.</li>
      <li>You might want to try playing with the <a href="http://ironcreek.net/phpsyntaxtree/">PHP
          previewer</a> a bit beforehand.</li>
    </ul>
