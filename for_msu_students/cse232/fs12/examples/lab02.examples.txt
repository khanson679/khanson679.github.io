1. Type Sizes

Size of integer data objects (in bytes)

  short:        2
  int:          4
  long:         8

Size of floating point data objects (in bytes)

  float:        4
  double:       8

Size of other data objects (in bytes)

  char:         1
  bool:         1
  void*:        8
 
 
2. Typecasting
 
For our purposes, "(int) 3.5" (C notation) the same as "int(3.5)" (function notation). You will not enounted any differences in 232.


3. Increment/Decrement

x++ or ++x alone same as "x = x + 1;"
x-- or --x alone same as "x = x - 1;"

But they are different on the right side of assignment.

y = x++; same as
	y = x;
	x = x + 1;
	
y = ++x; same as
	x = x + 1;
	y = x;
	
	
4. Variable Initialization

int x = 3; same as
	int x;
	x = 3;
	
Usually better to use the initialization notation.


5. CamelCase

variables and functions: someObject, someFunction
class names:             ClassName

You may see other conventions, but I recommend these ones, which are used in both C++ and Java.
