    <h2>Project 8 Extra Notes</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Attack Plan</h3>
    <p>Start by fixing any problems from project 7, then continue on to the new
      functions.</p>
    <p>Operator&gt;&gt; is fairly hard, and it's unnecessary for testing any
      other function, so it should be the last thing you do. This should be
      obvious by now, but many people structured their Project 6 testing modules
      in such a way that it looks like they didn't follow our advice.</p>
    <h3>Operator&gt;&gt;</h3>
    <p>For this one, it is especially critical that you develop the function in
      several stages. Start with the simple case, where there is no leading
      whitespace, and get it to work for a single string, stopping at the first
      whitespace character<strong></strong>. You will need to input to a char
      array locally, checking that the input was successful, then call the
      constructor to store the new string.</p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><code>istream&amp;
        operator&gt;&gt;(istream&amp; ist, String&amp; item)</code><br>
      <code>{</code><br>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><code>// build char array</code><code></code><br>
        <code>char array[256];</code><br>
        <code>...</code><br>
        <code></code><br>
        <code>//</code><code> store in object</code><code><br>
          if (...)<br>
        </code><code>&nbsp; item = String(array);</code><code><br>
        </code><code><br>
        </code><code>return ist;</code></div>
      <code>}</code></div>
    <p>Obviously, this requires operator= to be working.</p>
    <p>Depending on how you did this, you may need to do some extra work to skip
      leading whitespace. The easiest way is to use peek() to look ahead in the
      input stream and get() to throw out characters one at a time in a loop.<span
        style="font-family: monospace;"><br>
      </span></p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><code>char ch;</code><br>
      <code>ch = ist.peek(); // returns next character </code><code><code>(WS
          or no</code><code>t)</code>, but leaves it in the input buffer</code><br>
      <code>ch = ist.get();&nbsp; // removes next character </code><code></code><code>from
        input buffer and stores it</code><br>
      <code>ist.get();&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; // removes next character
        without storing it</code><br>
      <code></code></div>
    <p></p>
    <p>Other methods involve some combination of the following istream functions
      and manipulators:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>operator&gt;&gt;()</li>
      <ul>
        <li>skipws</li>
        <li>noskipws</li>
        <li>ws</li>
      </ul>
      <li>unget()</li>
      <li>putback()</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can read about these on the <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/istream/istream/">cplusplus.com
        istream reference page</a>.</p>
    <p>No matter what you do, ideally, you should not consume any whitespace
      following the string you just read. However, if you cannot get the
      function to skip leading whitespace, then it will need to consume (though
      perhaps not store) at least one character per call in order for it to ever
      read more than one string (a very strange state of affairs). To reiterate:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Best case: skips leading whitespace and doesn't consume trailing
        whitespace</li>
      <li>Okay: doesn't skip leading whitespace, but does consume trailing
        whitespace</li>
      <li>Bad: doesn't skip leading whitespace or consume trailing whitespace</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Testing</h3>
    <p>You must use a variety of test cases to make sure that each function
      behaves as it should. In operator== from Project 7, for example, you
      needed to compare strings with the same length but different characters in
      order to see if the loop actually worked.</p>
    <p>Do each function one at a time, testing the critical cases. Do not use an
      input loop that calls every function for every test case. Print your
      strings in quotes or brackets so you can easily tell whether or not there
      is leading/trailing whitespace.</p>
    <p>Be careful with operator= and operator+= since they must do several
      things, like the value constructor. Again, you can run your program in
      "valgrind" to find out if it is deallocating memory properly.</p>
    <p>With operator&gt;&gt;, you must test that it is ignoring whitespace
      properly. The most clear way to demonstrate this is to NOT use an input
      loop, but to label each case properly ("this is what I'm inputting") and
      put exactly the right contents in your "tests" file. Using an input loop
      is okay, but not ideal.</p>
    <h3>Constructor and Assignment Syntax</h3>
    <p>When you test constructors, note that the following lines all call the
      copy constructor:</p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">String b(a);<br>
      String b = a;<br>
      String b = String(a);<br>
    </div>
    <p>In order to test operator=, you must declare the object separately.</p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">String c;<br>
      c = a;</div>
    <p> This is true for value constructors as well, if there is only one
      parameter. See the example on <a href="file:///C:/Users/Kenneth/AppData/Local/Temp/examples/constructors_and_assignment.cpp">constructors
        and assignment</a> for the full picture.</p>
