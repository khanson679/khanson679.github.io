    <h2>Project 6 Extra Notes</h2>
    <h3>Incremental Development</h3>
    <p>You should follow the advice in the notes file, starting by writing stubs
      and getting everything to compile. Next, get your constructors working. If
      they do not work, the rest of your project cannot be tested.</p>
    <h3>Testing</h3>
    <p>You must test every constructor and member function thoroughly, including
      all bases cases as well as error cases. Do not repeatedly test one
      function with values that are not expected to behave differently, such as
      3/4, 5/6, 7/8, which all have an odd numerator that is smaller than the
      even denominator.</p>
    <p>You can do almost all of your testing by using the constructors to create
      objects to manipulate. You can simply name them <em>frac1, frac2,</em>
      etc. If you pick good numbers, you can reuse each Rational object for
      several tests.</p>
    <p>Because your fractions are supposed to be printable, you can potentially
      print your variables themselves in the labels rather than printing
      variable names or values manually.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><code>cout &lt;&lt; frac1 &lt;&lt; " &lt; "
        &lt;&lt; frac2 &lt;&lt; " : " &lt;&lt; frac1 &lt; frac2 &lt;&lt; endl;</code><br>
    </p>
    <p>You might also find it useful to use <em>unnamed objects</em> in your
      driver, which are created by calling the constructor in the middle of any
      normal statement.<br>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><code>cout &lt;&lt; "3/4 &lt; 7/8 : " &lt;&lt;
        Rational(3, 4) &lt; Rational(7, 8) &lt;&lt; endl;</code></p>
    <p>Experiment with both methods and see which works for you.</p>
    <p>Operator&gt;&gt; should be the absolute last thing you write and test,
      because it is not needed by anything else. Make a simple test file with
      several good fractions and one incorrectly formatted one, and make an
      input loop at the end of the driver that reads and prints them. You can
      try to do more with this one, but it's not necessary.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Output Formatting</h3>
    <p>All output must be labeled and formatted so that it is completely obvious
      to the reader what is going on, <strong>without</strong><strong>
        requiring them to look at the source code</strong>. The lab is not the
      best example of this, so focus on the following strategy for each test:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Say what you did.</li>
      <li>Show the result.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You may be able to create more concise ways of formatting your tests,
      especially when you have several of the same test in a row. But you should
      never sacrifice readability for compactness. As always, remember to add
      space to create sections, and align values after labels. Don't double
      space your output.</p>
    <p>By default, boolean values print as "1" or "0", which is not appropriate
      for this kind of output. Remember to use "boolalpha" to set the print
      forms to "true" and "false".<br>
