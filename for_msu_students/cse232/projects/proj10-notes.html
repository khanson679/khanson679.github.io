    <h2>Project 10 Extra Notes</h2>
    <h3>Deques and Doubly Linked Lists</h3>
    <p>The double-ended queue, or deque, is a very natural fit for a
      doubly-linked list, since you get fast inserts and removes, and don't have
      to rellocate an array.</p>
    <p>The array implementation has advantages too, but is used mainly when you
      want random access to all elements. It's also significantly more
      complicated to write. STL Deque will be discussed in lecture.</p>
    <h3>Implementation</h3>
    <p>This deque is a template. Template syntax is a pain at first and easy to
      mess up. You would be insane not to start with stubs for this one.</p>
    <p>Most of the functions do not require iteration, but you need to be
      careful that you relink everything properly. Head should point to the
      "front" of the chain, and Tail to the "back" (this should be obvious, but
      people seem to mess it up a lot).</p>
    <p>If you use dummy nodes, then iteration stops when your pointer is the
      same as Head or Tail, except in display, since you need to display the
      dummy nodes.</p>
    <h3>display()</h3>
    <p>Use a table. It should be aligned in columns with proper headers.</p>
    <p>Follow the suggestions in the project notes file. The main thing I would
      add is that you should put the node address (this) between Pred and Succ.
      This will make it easy to see that the chain is linked correctly, since
      you'll get each address 3 times diagonally.</p>
