Some of the resources I made for MSU students in linguistics, Japanese, and computer science are listed below.

## [CSE 232 SS13 Section 1 Site](cse232)
Resources from the last semester I was a TA for the class.

## [Japanese Flashcards](jpn)
For Tobira (textbook) and JPN 401/402, for use with Anki (SRS flashcard software).

## [LaTeX and Tree Drawing Workshops](latex)
For LIN 434 (Intro to Syntax).

## [qUALMS Conlanging Workshop (FS13)](conlanging)
A first attempt at making a structured system for designing artificial (human) languages. We determined that 90 minutes wasn't long enough.
