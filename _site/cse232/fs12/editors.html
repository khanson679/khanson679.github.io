    <h1>Text Editors and IDEs<br>
    </h1>
    <p>Unlike word processors, text editors are designed for
      manipulating
      raw text, without fonts, bullets, tables, and so on. You can
      program with any basic text editor, but some editors will than
      others depending on your needs. For example, the typesetting
      language LaTeX is is much easier to use with an editor with good
      auto-completion features.</p>
    <p>IDEs typically contain at least a debugger and build automation
      tools in addition to an editor. IDEs also tend to have much better
      language-specific goodies than editors.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Linux Editors<br>
    </h2>
    <p>Some Linux terminal editors installed on the CSE computers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Vim (or the original "vi")</li>
      <li>Emacs</li>
      <li>Nano</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You will learn how to use Vim in Project 1, but
      after that you are free to use any editor or IDE (integrated
      development environment) you choose.</p>
    <p>Many people love Vim and hate Emacs, or vis versa, so if you
      don't like Vim, give Emacs a try. (See the <a
        href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/%7Ecse232/General/">CSE 232
        tutorials</a>.) If you decide to use Vim, make sure you enable
      syntax highlighting as described in the Vim tutorial.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Nano is easy to use, but not nearly as powerful as the other two
      editors (in particular, its auto-indentation is much more basic).
    </p>
    <h2>Linux IDEs<br>
    </h2>
    <p>Some graphical Linux editors and IDEs on the CSE computers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gedit (simple editor)</li>
      <li>Kate (simple IDE)</li>
      <li>Eclipse (powerful IDE)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Like Nano, Gedit has only very basic auto-indentation, but the
      editor has many plugins that you can download for additional
      functionality.</p>
    <p>Eclipse is what I used in CSE 335, and I recommend it for CSE
      232 as well. There is no shortcut in the menu on the CSE computers
      for
      some reason, so open a terminal and enter "eclipse &amp;" (the
      ampersand runs the program in a new process so you can close the
      terminal or use it for something else).<br>
    </p>
    <p>I have not used Kate much, but it's probably a good choice if you
      find Gedit too simple and Eclipse too complex.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Editor/IDE Configuration</h2>
    <p>Whichever editor or IDE you choose, make sure to enable syntax
      highlighting and auto-indentation, and set your tab width to 2 or
      4 spaces. I also like to use a color scheme
      with a dark background. Depending on your choice, you may also be
      able
      to set up auto-completion and templates for function headers, etc.</p>
    <h2>Working Remotely</h2>
    <p>If you log in to the CSE system remotely via SSH, you will be
      able
      to run any terminal editor with no further complications. In this
      case,
      you'll want to open an additional remote terminal to run your
      programs
      in. It's also possible to use graphical editors and IDEs remotely,
      though the connection will probably be too slow unless you're on
      campus
      or very close.<br>
