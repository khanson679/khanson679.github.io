<h2>General Information</h2>
<h3>Email Communication</h3>
<p>I will send important information, project feedback, etc.
via email in order to save time during lab for programming topics and
Q&amp;A. If you don't read your MSU email regularly, set up a
forwarder.</p>
<p>You can email me any time with any questions or concerns.
I read email at least once a day.</p>

<h2>Section Policies</h2>
<ul>
</ul>
<h3>Lab Sessions</h3>
<ul>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
Come only to your registered lab section. We don't have
enough computers for visitors.
</li>
<li>
Please come to lab on time. I will often announce
important information at the beginning of lab.
</li>
<li>
You may leave after completing the current week's lab
assignment, though I recommend you get started on the next programming
project before you leave.
</li>
<li>During lab, I will give priority to students who need help
with the current lab assignment. I will assist with projects and
anything else as time allows.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Lab Assignments</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Please check the section website before starting each lab.
I will sometimes post a modified version of the lab assignment.
</li>
<li>Per course-wide policy:</li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>
You are free to work alone or with other students on lab
assignments (but not on projects).<br>

</li>
<li>
I you miss lab due to illness or emergency, please
contact me ASAP. If the reason is valid, I will allow you to make up
the lab before the beginning of the following lab section.
</li>
<li>
If
you do attend lab, but are unable to complete the are unable to compete
a lab assignment by the end of the session, you will be able to
complete and turn it in by the
following lab session.
</li>
<li>
You must complete 12 out of the 15 lab assignments in
order to receive a non-failing grade in this course. I can give you my
record of the labs you've completed at any time, but it is your
responsibility to complete and turn in each lab assignment on time.
</li>
</ol>
<li>You are welcome to complete any lab assignment ahead of
time, in which case you can show it to me at the beginning of lab.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Programming Projects</h3>
<ul>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
Read the assignment specifications and notes documents
carefully. Everything you need to do is in there. Ask if you don't
understand the instructions.
</li>
<li>
Per course-wide policy, you may not work with other
students on the projects (you
can on the labs). The code you submit will be electronically compared
with current and past submissions, and it's easy to get your code
flagged by working with others even if you didn't intend to cheat.
</li>
<li>
Contact Mr. McCullen ASAP if you miss a project deadline
due to
illness or emergency, or have problems with the Handin system when
turning in a project.
</li>
<li>
Do not modify any project files after the due date. If you
have any problems with Handin, you will need the timestamps on your
files to precede the due date in order to prove that you finished the
assignment on time.
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
</ul>
<h3>Grading</h3>
<ul>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
If you think I've made a mistake in my grading, or if any
comments I leave on your score sheet are unclear, please email me ASAP.
</li>
<li>
I will not consider requests to raise a project grade,
except in the case where you believe I have graded you unfairly
compared to other students <span style="font-weight: bold;">in
this section</span>.<br>

</li>
<li>
I will not &#8220;pre-grade&#8221; projects under any circumstances.
This includes but is not limited to questions along the lines of &#8220;How
many points will I lose if ___ doesn't work when I turn it in?&#8221;
</li>

Policies</a> on the section website for details.</li>
