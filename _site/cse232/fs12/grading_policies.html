<h1>Grading Policies </h1>
<p> If your program meets the project specifications and follows
the coding standard, it's unlikely that you will lose more than a
couple points for random mistakes. Nonetheless, I know I appreciate
hearing this kind of stuff up front, so I will try to be explicit as
possible about how your projects will be scored.</p>
<p>Most of the information in this document is course-wide
policy, but I will emphasize the points that I think are most important.</p>
<h2>Scoring Basics</h2>
Most of the projects in this course will be worth between 30-50 points
each, totaling to 40% of your course grade. Each project will be scored
on the following criteria:<br>
<ol>
<li>Following the <a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/%7Ecse232/General/coding.standard">coding
standard</a></li>
<li>Functioning makefile</li>
<li>Program correctness</li>
<li>Output formatting (if applicable)<br>
</li>
<li>Testing code (if applicable)<br>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Just writing the code in and of itself does not earn you any
points. <b>If your code does not compile, or crashes before
producing any viable output, you can only receive credit for categories
(1) and (2).</b></p>
<h3>Coding Standard<br>
</h3>
<p>Category (1) will be graded by deduction. For each criteria of
the coding standard that the program fails to meet, I will deduct
points until none remain for the category. In other words, you might
meet several of the criteria while receiving a score of 0 for the
category.<br>
</p>
<p>The coding standard boils down to (a) formatting and (b)
documentation. These are basic programming skills, and our requirements
are not complicated, so there is no excuse for not following the coding
standard.<br>
</p>
<h3>Makefiles<br>
</h3>
<p>If your makefile works, you get full credit for category (2).
If there is a small problem, you will receive partial credit. If there
is one large problem or several small problems, you will receive no
credit. The makefiles for the projects in this course will be almost
identical, so this one should be a freebie. </p>
<h3>Program Correctness</h3>
<p>For full credit in category (3), your program must meet all of
the project specifications. Within category (3), each specification
will be graded somewhat independently, so it's possible to earn full,
partial, or no credit for each specification.</p>
<p>You
need to test your programs thoroughly in order to ensure that they
produce good output for all normal input. You also need to include
error handling code to prevent special cases from crashing the program
or creating garbage output.<br>
<br>
See below for the policy on partial credit.<br>
</p>
<h3>Output Formatting<br>
</h3>
<p>For category (4), program output must always:<br>
</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Follow the project specifications<br>
</li>
<li>Display correctly in an 80 character wide terminal</li>
<li>Be labeled and formatted so that it is:</li>
<ol type="a">
<li>easily readable, and<br>
</li>
<li>understandable to a reader who has not seen the source
code</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>I would like to give special emphasis to the last point. You
may know what your unlabeled output means, but your user doesn't, and
it's not their job to figure it out.<br>
</p>
<h3>Testing Code<br>
</h3>
<p>For category (5), testing code must always:</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Test all functions and logic paths in the main code</li>
<li>Test all reasonable categories of input</li>
<ul>
<li>For example, if you have a function uses the sine of some
input value, you must test input values from all four quadrants.<br>
</li>
</ul>
<li>Test all typical special cases</li>
<ul>
<li>This includes any input that is likely to crash the
program or produce nonsensical output.</li>
<li>As you do this, make sure you fix your code to handle any
unhandled special cases!</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<ul>
<ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Your testing code should change as you develop your program.
Remove any unnecessary tests at the end, but leave in enough to prove
that you tested thoroughly.<br>
</p>
<h2>Project Feedback</h2>
<p>For each project, you will receive a scoresheet with comments
via email. I take these very seriously, and would appreciate it if you
do as well. I will give very detailed comments for the first couple
projects in in order to help you master C++ more quickly.<br>
</p>
<p>Scoresheets will usually be returned within one week of the
project due date, and almost always before the next project. If you
believe there is a problem with a scoresheet, please email me ASAP. If
I made a mistake, I will fix it and update your grade.<br>
</p>
<h2>Partial Credit</h2>
There are two kinds of partial credit you can receive for each project
specification:<br>
<ol>
<li>Partial credit for components that partially meet project
specifications</li>
<li>Partial credit for components that do not the project
specifications, but would if it weren't for a small programming mistake.</li>
</ol>
<p>For category (1), points will be assigned based on the degree
to which the component meets project specifications. Failure to handle
special cases will lose you fewer points than bad output for more
typical input.<br>
</p>
<p>For category (2), you must understand that <span style="font-weight: bold;">I am not obligated to try to find
your mistakes in order to give you partial credit for program
components that do not work properly.</span> That being said, I
will usually try to do so for your benefit. Because of this, it's in
your best interest to make your code as readable as possible.</p>
<p> In general, small problems will result in 0.5 to 1 point
deductions, and larger problems will result in the loss of a proportion
of the total points for the category.</p>
<p>There are two specific situations in which I definitely will <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> search for your
mistakes:</p>
<ol>
<li>If your testing code is poor or non-existent, or it is
otherwise obvious that you did not test your code properly</li>
<li>If your code is poorly formatted and/or poorly documented,
making it unnecessarily difficult for me to interpret it</li>
</ol>
<h2>Interdependent Code<br>
</h2>
<p>Often, a problem in one component of the program will ruin
otherwise correct output from other components of the program.
Sometimes, the effects of this are transparent enough that I can give
you full credit for the dependent components without any trouble.</p>
<p>However, when this is not the case, <span style="font-weight: bold;">I am not obligated to try to
"fix" your code and rerun our tests in order to give the the maximum
possible score for the dependent components.</span> I may choose
to do so if I believe it is warranted and easy to do so, but it your
responsibility to identify the most core components of your program and
make sure they work.</p>
<h2>Additional Penalties</h2>
<p>I may deduct additional points for programs that show truly
horrible design decisions, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Duplicate code
</li>
<li>
Failing to break complex code into multiple functions
</li>
<li>
Failing to break large programs with multiple distinct
components into multiple files
</li>
<li>
Putting implementation code in header files (except for short inline functions)
</li>
<li>
#include-ing implementation files
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Freebies</h2>
Occasionally, I may decide not to deduct points for some particular
issue, usually when I think something in the instructions was unclear.
In this case, I will generally write "-0" followed by a comment on the
relevant section of the affected score sheets.<br>
<h2>Grade Disputes</h2>

<p> I try to grade as accurately and consistently as possible,
but if you believe I have graded one of your projects unfairly <span style="font-weight: bold;">compared to other students in
this section</span>, I will take another look.</p><p>However, I have no
control over how the other TAs grade their students, so I will not
consider complaints along the line of "so-and-so didn't take off points
for [insert problem here]". In other words, all grading decisions are
final for the current project.You
can still let me know about these kinds of issues, but any changes I
make will only affect future projects.</p><p>If you believe that grading
between the TAs is unequal in general, you should inform Mr. McCullen
directly. </p>
