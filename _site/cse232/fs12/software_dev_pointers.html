Development Pointers</b></font></h1>

<ol>
<li>Always
	have code that compiles.
	<ul><li>Start
		by writing core class and function declarations, and stubs for all
		functions (including main). Write all of your file, class and
		function headers now (you can change them later). Write the
		makefile and make sure the project compiles before beginning the real coding.
		</li><li>As
		you develop your code, compile VERY frequently, on the order of
		every 3-10 lines. You don't have to test your code necessarily,
		just make sure there are no compiler errors. (Having an extra terminal
		open makes this easy.)
	</li></ul>
	</li><li>Practice
	incremental development &#8211; always have code that mostly works.
	<ul><li>Don't
		try to solve complicated problems all at once. Get some of the
		framework in place (initial steps, outer loops, etc) and make sure
		those steps are working before continuing. This way, you won't end
		up with 50 lines of code that don't work and have no clue where the
		problem is.
	</li></ul>
	</li><li>Document
	your code as you go.
	<ul><li>Tell
		what you're going to do before you do it, for everything except
		very trivial code. Verbalizing your plans will force you to check
		that what you're doing makes sense.
	</li></ul>
	</li><li>Test
	every possibility.
	<ul><li>Make
		sure every logic path (if-else, switch-case, loop conditions, mid-loop breaks) works
		as intended.
		</li><li>Make
		sure your program works for a variety of input, not just a couple
		cases (This time, you're not thinking about your code's structure,
		but trying to find any input that might not work as expected).
		</li><li>Check
		for input errors (e.g., bad input that doesn't necessarily have a
		correct output). Even if your documentation states that some
		input will have undefined output, you at least need to make sure
		your program won't crash.
	</li></ul>
</li>
