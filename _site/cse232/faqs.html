    <h1>FAQs</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Why do I have to learn C++ anyway?<br>
        Plenty of reasons.</li>
      <ol>
        <li>It's a high-level language, but close enough to the hardware that we
          can use it to study how data structures are stored in memory.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Tons of people use it, and its predecessor, C, too. Both are in
          general use in a range of areas, so you can't go wrong by learning one
          (or both).<br>
        </li>
        <li>It's easy to move from C++ to C, or to a higher level language like
          Java or C#.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Because you can't use Python for everything. It's an amazing
          language, but it's slow and just not designed for operating systems,
          device drivers, and other high performance areas.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Why isn't Handin working?</li>
      <ol>
        <li>In most cases, because you typed the command wrong. Check each part
          again.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Help! I just got dozens of errors when compiling!</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Scroll up to the top of the list, and tackle the first one. Often,
          the first error is the cause of all the others.<br>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
