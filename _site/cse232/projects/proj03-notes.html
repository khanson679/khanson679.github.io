    <h2>Project 3 Extra Notes
    </h2>
    <h3>1. Variable Names</h3>
    <p>You must use proper variable names. If you copy the provided stubs,
      immediately rename the variables, so you don't have to do a find-replace
      later.</p>
    <h3>2. If-Else Formatting</h3>
    <p>I've added a section to the <a href="https://www.msu.edu/%7Ehanson54/cse232/coding-style.html">C++
        Coding Style Guide</a>.</p>
    <h3>3. Testing Conditional Logic</h3>
    <p>Since there are multiple logic paths each function execution could take,
      you need to test each possible path to be sure your code works. In this
      project, this means entering various (carefully chosen) meter readings and
      codes into the prompts.</p>
