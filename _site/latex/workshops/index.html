	<p>Find the materials for your workshop in the next section. The remainder of this 
	page contains some general information and resources.</p>
	<h2>Instructions and Materials</h2>
	 <h3>LIN 434 Basic Tree Drawing</h3>
	 <ul>
		 <li><a href="434-FS13">FS13 (10/17)</a></li>
		 <li><a href="434-SS13">SS13 (3/1)</a></li>
	 </ul>
	<h2>Background</h2>
    <p>TeX is a specialized computer language used for typesetting documents.
      LaTeX is essentially a collection of TeX macros (i.e. shortcuts) that make 
	the process of &quot;programming&quot; a document easy enough for general users. If 
	you've ever used HTML/CSS, the concept is similar.</p>
    <p>The basic purpose of using LaTeX rather than Microsoft Word or some other
      desktop publishing program is that it fully separates formatting from
      content, making it possible to change the formatting for your document by
      making changes in only one place. LaTeX also features powerful 
	bibliography and citation features, which are a huge help when writing 
	academic papers. And because TeX is a very good
      typesetter, it's very easy to get professional-looking results.</p>
    <p>But the reason that you really want to learn LaTeX is that it makes it much easier to write papers in subjects like math, philosophy, and linguistics, 
	which use many non-alphabetic symbols and other specialized 
	notations. For linguistics, it will automatically number your examples and 
	format your glosses, and in the case of syntax, it allows you to draw perfect
      trees.</p>
	<p>Despite all of its advantages, LaTeX has a bit of a learning curve. 
	Because of this, we'll start by drawing simple bracketed trees wth the <a href="http://ironcreek.net/phpsyntaxtree/">
	PHP Tree Drawer</a>, and go from there.</p>
    <a name=editors></a>
    <h2>Text Editors</h2>
    <p>LaTeX files are created and modified using a text editor. Bracketed trees
      (even outside of LaTeX) are likewise easiest to create and modify using a 
	text editor.</p>
	 <h3>Sublime Text</h3>
	<p>There are many good text editors out there, but for simplicity, everyone 
	should use <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a> for these workshops, which works on all major operating systems and has an 
	unlimited free trial.</p>
	 <p>Notes:</p>
	 <ul>
		 <li>When you install Sublime Text, you do not need to 
	check the box that adds the program to the context menu.</li>
		 <li>If you don't like how Sublime Text inserts closing brackets 
		 automatically, go to Preferences -&gt; Settings - User and insert the 
		 following line between the brackets in the settings file, then save and 
		 close:<ul>
			 <li>&quot;auto_match_enabled&quot;: false</li>
		 </ul>
		 </li>
	 </ul>
	 <h3>Other Editors</h3>
	 <p>Some other (free and open source) text editors include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> (Windows only, 
		very good)</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.geany.org">Geany</a> (Windows/Linux, similar to 
		Notepad++)</li>
		<li><a href="http://jedit.org">jEdit</a> (cross-platform, requires Java, 
		annoying in some places)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Note that the built-in Windows editor, Notepad, lacks auto-indentation 
	and other critical features and is thus nearly useless. TextEdit in OSX is 
	more of a word processor than a text editor and is likewise not appropriate 
	for the task at hand.</p>
	<!--
	<p>Never used a text editor before? See the following page for some basic 
	tips:</p>
