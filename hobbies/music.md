I mainly play two instruments: the piano, which everyone knows, and the [marimba](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marimba), a large keyboard percussion instrument.

I've played the piano since I was 8, taking lessons through the end of high school and continuing to play on my own since. I started playing percussion in band class in 5th grade, and also did marching band and [winter drumline](http://wgi.org/contents/What-is-WGI.html) (a.k.a. indoor percussion) in all four years of high school. During college, I took marimba lessons for 4 semesters.

Below are some pieces I've played recently.
