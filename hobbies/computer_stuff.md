## Operating Systems and Desktop Environments

I'm currently running [Kubuntu] as my primary OS.
Kubuntu is a version of [Ubuntu][] using the [KDE Plasma desktop environment][kde], which is fully-featured, customizable, and surprisingly well-performing.

I used Windows 7 for most purposes other than programming up until 2015, when I switched to using Linux full time (initially Linux Mint followed by Kubuntu). Based on my experiences, I encourage other Windows 7 refugees to give Kubuntu a try.

## Recommended Free Software

This is a list of free programs (many open source) that have proven
useful to me. Most are Windows programs or cross-platform.

Notes:

- To my knowledge, all of the programs listed as "Windows" work on
 Windows 7, and likely work on XP/Vista/8/10 as well.
  - "Mac" here always means Mac OS X.
- Some programs may have Mac/Linux/Android versions even if not noted
 here, especially if they are new or poorly marketed.
- On Linux, many of these kinds of programs are simply unnecessary as
 your distribution will likely include an adequate tool in the default
 installation.

## Getting Started with Linux

Linux is now at a point where it's fairly easy for non-computer
specialists to switch over and take advantage of a free, robust, and
endlessly customizable operating system. Why bother? In my mind, there
are quite a few:

1. **To avoid vendor lock-in.** The Linux world is predominantly [free
 and
 open-source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software).
 It's unlikely that you will ever be stuck with files that cannot be
 opened. In the worst case, the program that created them will still
 be freely available.

2. **To take advantage of the power of a Unix-like OS.** Some things
 just work better on a Linux (or Unix), which is built to be fast,
 secure, and modular. Many administrative tasks that are difficult or
 error-prone in Windows, like putting your home directory on a
 separate hard drive, are dead simple in Linux. Your computer will
 install updates only when you give the OK (no mysterious background
 installers running at inopportune moments). It's also a much nicer
 programming environment. (This is less relevant for Mac users, since
 Mac OS X is based on Unix.)
 
3. **To have the ability to fully customize your system**. This is
 related to \#2. For example, you may dislike some aspects of the
 default user interface for your OS, but since many graphical desktop
 environments are available for Linux, you get the freedom to choose
 one that suits your needs and preferences. You also have much more
 freedom to customize things like docks/taskbars, menus, and keyboard
 shortcuts without installing sketchy external software.

4. **To give new life to older hardware**. Except for some
 computational or graphically intensive programs, you can have the
 benefits of up-to-date software on hardware that is 5-10 years old
 or more. Now that Windows XP has been discontinued, Linux offers a
 way to avoid replacing old computers in order to maintain a secure,
 usable system. (The same goes for old Macs). Often, the most you
 would need to revive a 10-year-old computer is a \$30-40 memory
 upgrade.
 
5. **Because you believe in the value of free and open-source software
 generally**. Commercial software companies don't always act in their
 customers' best interests, so supporting free, high quality
 alternatives will put pressure on them to step up their game.

I would say that the primary downside to Linux, even today, is that it
has an inherent learning curve -- you get a lot of power, but need to
understand a bit in order to use it. You will have to understand the
concept of a window manager, for example, in order to swap one for
another. You will also have to use the command line occasionally, if
only to copy and paste code from web forums (because graphical tools
vary more than command line tools, help will usually be given in the
most general form).


My recommendation is to start by experimenting with Linux in a virtual
machine (using [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)), so that there
is no chance of hurting the rest of your data accidentally. Try
downloading and installing one of the more user-friendly distros, such
as [Mint](http://www.linuxmint.com/), [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/),
[OpenSUSE](http://www.opensuse.org/), or
[Mageia](https://www.mageia.org/en/), and playing around a bit. A Linux
*distro*, short for "distribution", includes the Linux kernel (the core
of the OS) and other basic components as well as a collection of
ready-to-install, compatibility-checked software packages which can be
downloaded from a centralized repository.


Most distros offer several versions of the install CD/DVD with different
desktop environments; I recommend
[Cinnamon](http://cinnamon.linuxmint.com/),
[MATE](http://mate-desktop.org/) and [KDE](http://kde.org/), which are
among the most user-friendly and familiar in feel for Windows users (and
probably the least obnoxious for Mac users as well). For older
computers, the very traditional [XFCE](http://xfce.org/) works extremely
well. The two other biggies, [Gnome 3](http://www.gnome.org/gnome-3/)
and [Unity](https://unity.ubuntu.com/), are less traditional and
currently suffer from the Windows 8-like "you can do it our way and no
other" syndrome. Unity also tries to be like a tablet on the desktop,
again like Windows 8.

Many install disks double as "live" CD/DVDs, which allow you to test the
OS and desktop environment on your system before installing, which is
extremely helpful for confirming hardware compatibility. If you don't
want to bother with testing every combination, just go for Mint +
Cinnamon. This combination is exceptionally easy to use, and Mint users
can install most packages from the well-known Ubuntu as well as its
parent, [Debian](http://www.debian.org/).


Once you find a distro and desktop environment that you like, you can
either install it alongside your current OS (if you chose Mint or
Ubuntu, which can install to a virtual hard drive inside Windows while
still booting natively) or partition your hard drive for a true dual
boot system. Other people have already written about this better than I
can -- Google is your friend.
