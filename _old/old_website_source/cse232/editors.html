    <h1>Text Editors and IDEs<br>
    </h1>
    <p>Unlike word processors, text editors are designed for manipulating raw
      text, without fonts, bullets, tables, and so on. You can program with any
      basic text editor, but some editors will than others depending on your
      needs and preferences.</p>
    <p>IDEs typically contain at least a debugger and build automation tools in
      addition to an editor. IDEs also tend to have much better
      language-specific goodies than editors.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Linux Editors<br>
    </h2>
    <p>There are several terminal editors installed on the CSE computers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Vim (or the original "vi")</li>
      <li>Emacs</li>
      <li>Nano</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You will learn how to use Vim in Project 1, but after that you are free
      to use any editor or IDE (integrated development environment) you choose.</p>
    <p>Many people love Vim and hate Emacs, or vis versa, so if you don't like
      Vim, give Emacs a try (see the <a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/%7Ecse232/General/">CSE
        232 tutorials</a>). Note that the version of Vim installed on the CSE
      computers is somewhat crippled in its functionality until you enable those
      features by creating a <a href="vim.html">.vimrc file</a>. Nano is easy
      to use, but not nearly as powerful as the other two editors (in
      particular, its auto-indentation is very basic).</p>
    <h2>Graphical Editors<br>
    </h2>
    <p>Both Vim and Emacs also have graphical versions that allow you to use the
      mouse for cut/copy/paste, etc., but only the graphical version of Emacs is
      currently available on the CSE machines.</p>
    <p>There are also several purely graphical editors available:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gedit (Gnome)<br>
      </li>
      <li>Kwrite (KDE)<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Because both Gnome and KDE are installed on the CSE computers, you can
      use programs from both desktop environments. Like Nano, Gedit has only
      very basic auto-indentation (and very few built-in features in general),
      but the editor has many plugins that you can download for additional
      functionality. Kwrite is a bit more powerful.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Linux IDEs<br>
    </h2>
    There are two IDEs available on the CSE computers:
    <ul>
      <li>Kate (simple)</li>
      <li>Eclipse (powerful)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Eclipse is what I used in CSE 335, and I recommend it for CSE 232 as
      well, if you're interested in learning how to use it. There is no shortcut
      in the menu on the CSE computers for some reason, so open a terminal and
      enter "eclipse &amp;" (the ampersand runs the program in a new process so
      you can close the terminal or use it for something else).<br>
    </p>
    <p>I have not used Kate much, but it's probably a good choice if you find
      Gedit/Kwrite too simple and Eclipse too complex.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Editor/IDE Configuration</h2>
    <p>Whichever editor or IDE you choose, there are a couple features you will
      definitely want to enable: syntax highlighting and auto-indentation.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Syntax highlighting colors each "word" in your program according to
        its function, making your code easier to read. <br>
      </li>
      <li>Simple auto-indentation just keeps the current level of indentation,
        so you don't have to press tab so many times. Advanced auto-indentation
        automatically indents and de-indents the current line based on the
        language you are using. In C++, this means whenever you enter an opening
        or closing brace.</li>
    </ul>
    You should also set your tab width to 2 or 4 spaces (8 is typically
    unnecessary). You can use either real tabs or "soft tabs" (replaced by
    spaces); just don't use both in the same file -- this causes the formatting
    to get messed up when someone opens your code under a different tab width
    than what you used.<br>
    <p>I also find it much easier on the eyes to use color scheme with a dark
      background, if possible. Depending on your choice of editor, you may also
      be able to set up auto-completion and templates for function headers, etc.</p>
    <p>I've written up a little bit about <a href="vim.html">configuring Vim</a>.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Working Remotely</h2>
    <p>If you log in to the CSE system remotely via SSH, you will be able to run
      any terminal editor with no further complications. In this case, you'll
      want to open an additional remote terminal to run your programs in. It's
      also possible to use graphical editors and IDEs remotely, though the
      connection will probably be too slow unless you're on campus or very
      close.<br>
