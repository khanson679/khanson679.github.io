<h1>Working Remotely</h1><p>
You can access the CSE system remotely by logging into the server
Adriatic (adriatic.cse.msu.edu) via SSH.</p><p>See the <a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/%7Ecse232/General/system.hints">CSE
232 System Hints</a> for some basic info on using SSH. The
remainder of this page provides some more detailed info.</p><h2>SSH Basics</h2>
<p>SSH itself is just a protocol -- an SSH client uses this
protocol to access a computer running an SSH server.</p><p>Most&nbsp;Linux computers (including the CSE worksations),
as well as MacOS X, have a command-line SSH client installed. Use the following command to log in to the remote computer:</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">ssh
(username@)address</p><p>Notes:</p><ul><li>If the username field is missing, the
SSH client will use the same username that you are logged on with on
your local computer.</li><li>The address can be an IP address or a hostname (like&nbsp;adriatic.cse.msu.edu).</li><li>If
you are on the CSE network (for example, if you are using a lab
computer), you can skip the ".cse.msu.edu" part and just type
"adriatic" for the hostname.</li><li>All
student-accessible CSE
servers use the default SSH port (22). To access other servers, you may
need to change it by adding a command line option: ssh address -p port.</li><li>Exit from any SSH login by entering "exit".</li></ul>

<h2>SSH Clients for Windows</h2>
<p>Some SSH clients for Windows include:</p>
<ul>
<li>SSHWin
(available for CSE students at <font style="font-size: 11pt;" size="2"><a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/facility/software/">http://www.cse.msu.edu/facility/software</a></font>)</li>
<li>PuTTY (available at <font style="font-size: 11pt;" size="2"><a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/%7Esgtatham/putty/">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/)</a></font></li><li><font style="font-size: 11pt;" size="2">Xshell (free for students at <a href="http://www.netsarang.com/download/free_license.html">http://www.netsarang.com/download/free_license.html</a>)<br></font></li>
</ul>
<p>Personally, I use and recommend PuTTY.</p><p>The main advantage to
SSHWin is its ability to open multiple sessions without typing in your
password more than once.
Unfortunately, the default background is white, and I have not been
able to configure colored text to be readable on a black background
using this program.</p><p>I have not used Xshell much, but it has a black background like PuTTY, and easily clones sessions like SSHWin.<br>
</p>
<h2>PuTTY Hints<br>
</h2>
<ol>
<li><font style="font-size: 11pt;" size="2">Use
&#8220;USERNAME@adriatic.cse.msu.edu&#8221; as the computer name and save a profile
to avoid having to type in your username every time.</font></li><li><font style="font-size: 11pt;" size="2">See this page for some configuration recommendations: <a href="http://dag.wieers.com/blog/improving-putty-settings-on-windows">http://dag.wieers.com/blog/improving-putty-settings-on-windows</a>.<br></font></li></ol><ul>
</ul>
<h2> Running Graphical Linux Programs Remotely</h2>
<p> In order to run graphical linux programs on a remote
computer, you will need to install an X11 server on your local machine
(X11 is the most basic component of any graphical Linux system).</p><p>On a graphical Linux system, you should be able to open graphical applications with no further issues.</p><p>On Mac, you may need to install X11 depending on which version you have. Get it at <a href="http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki">http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki</a>.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>For Windows,
you can use the program Xming.<br></p>
<h2>Using Xming on Windows<br>
</h2>
<h3>Setup</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<font style="font-size: 11pt;" size="2">Install Xming &lt;<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xming">http://sourceforge.net/projects/xming</a>&gt;.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font style="font-size: 11pt;" size="2">Enable X11 tunneling.</font>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<font style="font-size: 11pt;" size="2">In SSH: Edit &#8594; Settings &#8594; Profile Settings&#8594;
Connections &#8594; Tunneling &#8594; Tunnel X11 connections</font>
</li>
<li>
<font style="font-size: 11pt;" size="2">In PuTTY: Connection &#8594; SSH &#8594; X11 &#8594; Enable X11
forwarding</font>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<font style="font-size: 11pt;" size="2">Save your settings so that you don't have to do
this every time.</font>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Every time you log in</h3>
<ol>
<li value="1">
 <font style="font-size: 11pt;" size="2">Start Xming (Not XLaunch). It's a background
program with a tray icon.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font style="font-size: 11pt;" size="2">Log in to Adriatic.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font style="font-size: 11pt;" size="2">Type the command line name of the program you want
to use (usually all lowercase), followed by any options and arguments, <b>ending
with an ampersand (&amp;)</b>. This creates a new process for
the program, and allows you to continue to use the terminal even while
the program is running.</font>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Coding on Windows/Mac<br>
</h2>
<p>We do not recommend you write and store your code on your own
computer, but there are reasons for which you might want to use an
editor on Windows or Mac instead of on Adriatic remotely while storing and running your code on the CSE system. For example,
when the connection is poor, there can be significant lag running even
a text-based editor remotely.<br>
</p>
<p>I have two solutions for you. The first is cross-platform, and
the second is Windows-specific.<br>
</p>
<p>Note that <b>you should not compile and test your code
on your own computer</b>, because you will be graded based on how
it executes on Adriatic, and only the CSE lab workstations are similar
enough that you can safely assume that there will be no differences.<br>
</p>
<h3>FileZilla<br>
</h3>
<p>You can use the FTP/SFTP client <a href="http://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a>,
which is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux, to open and edit your
files, and use your SSH client only for creating files and running code.<br>
</p>
<ol><li>Create a profile for logging in to Adriatic as in an SSH
client.</li><li>Choose SFTP as the protocol and "Normal" as the
authentication method.</li><li>Navigate to your project folder. Right click on
the file, and choose "View/Edit". It should open in your default
program for that file type.</li><li>Edit and save your file, then click inside the FileZilla
window and upload the file. Now you can compile and execute your code
in your SSH client.</li></ol>On Windows, the default program will almost certainly be the
useless Notepad, <b>which is not compatible with Linux files</b>,
so you will need to install a real editor, such as <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>.
Open it, go to Edit -&gt; EOL Conversion, and choose "Unix Format".<br>


<p>Now you have several choices.<br>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Make your new editor the system default editor for .cpp and .h
files.</li>
<li>Set FileZilla's filetype associations in Edit -&gt;
Settings -&gt; FileEditing -&gt; Filetype Associations.</li>
<li>Tell FileZilla to use a custom editor for all files in Edit
-&gt; Settings -&gt; FileEditing.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Notepad++ and NppFTP</h3>
<p>Notepad++ also has a built-in FTP client, and can open files
from your CSE account directly (without the extra steps of downloading
and uploading in FileZilla).<br>
</p>
<p>Go to Plugins -&gt; NppFTP -&gt; Show NppFTP Window.
Create a profile as in FileZilla, the open, edit, and save as with any
other file. Use your SSH client to compile and run.<br>
