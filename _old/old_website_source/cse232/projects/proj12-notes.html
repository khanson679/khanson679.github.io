    <h2>Project 12 Extra Notes</h2>
    <h3>Recursive Functions<br>
    </h3>
    <p>I'd have one main recommendation: use wrapper functions. It's also
      possible to do the work without multiple functions, but things are more
      likely to go wrong or get really weird. Some hints:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Decide what needs to be done only once per function call. This work
        goes in the wrapper (user-callable) function, such as sine().</li>
      <li> Where the repeated calculation begins, call the recursive function
        with the appropriate initial parameters. So sine() can call sine_rec(),
        for example. This will be declared in the .cpp file rather than the .h
        file.</li>
      <li>Things that change between recursive calls should probably be
        parameters. Global variables might also work, but as mentioned in the
        project notes, they should not be used to exchange information between
        functions. If you go the parameter route then default parameters may be
        useful. You may also need parameters for values that do not change
        between recursive calls (but are parameters to the wrapper function).</li>
      <li>The recursive function will call itself until it reaches a base case,
        at which point it starts returning. Think about what to do to get from
        one step to the next. When the function decides that the current call is
        not a base case, it needs to take the return value of the recursive call
        and do something with it, then return the new value.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Misc.</h3>
    <p>Don't start by copying everything from the Project 5.&nbsp; Look at your
      scoresheet first and make sure you don't repeat any mistakes in the
      library or the driver. Open your old library alongside the new one, and
      copy bits of code if needed. You need factorial() and power() to work
      before you can do sine() and cosine().</p>
    <p>If you had good test cases last time, you will be able to recycle most of
      it. You might also want to give auxiliary testing functions a try, if you
      didn't last time. Note that your functions will probably hang or crash on
      smaller input values this time (remove those tests).</p>
    <p>Last, a warning: do not try turning in your old iterative functions. If
      you do, you might get a negative score.</p>
