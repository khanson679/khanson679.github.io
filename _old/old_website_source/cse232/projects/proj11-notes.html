    <h2>Project 11 Extra Notes</h2>
    <h3>Preliminaries</h3>
    <h3></h3>
    <p>Project 11 is an end user program. The basic rules are the same as with
      Project 5:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Break the program into functions and modules</li>
      <li>Use appropriate file organization</li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
    <p>As with the last such project, you have considerable freedom in choosing
      the design of your project, but at the same time it's extremely easy to
      get stuck if you fail to do so carefully. A warning: you will lose points
      for exceptionally bad program design.</p>
    <p>You may want to review the <a href="proj05-notes.html">notes for Project
        5</a> before continuing. Ask ASAP if you are unsure about what you're
      doing.</p>
    <h3>STL Containers and Algorithms</h3>
    <p>You will almost certainly want to make a class representing a
      municipality. This would also be a good name for the class, although it's
      a bit long. You can also use a struct if you prefer. Either way, any
      functions that operate on a single data record should go in this module.</p>
    <p>You must use an STL container to represent the table of data records.
      Vector, List, and Deque are all usable, but they are not equally
      appropriate, so think before you make your choice. You may NOT use an
      array. STL containers are far easier to use anyway.</p>
    <p>You should use the STL algorithms as much as possible. If you're having
      trouble using the "for_each" algorithm, you can just use "for" loops
      instead, preferably using iterators, operator[] as a last resort. However,
      you should NOT write your own sorting algorithm.</p>
    <h3>Program Design</h3>
    <p></p>
    <p>The biggest decision you have to make is whether to wrap your STL
      container in a class including functions that operate on the entire table.
      If you do this, you'll be locked into a fully object-oriented programming
      style, which we haven't had much practice with in this class. You will
      also have to be careful in how you design the I/O portion of the program.
      The file input portion would be appropriate to include in the class, but
      the user input portion would not. Because of these problems, you will most
      likely want to use a bare STL container and write a procedural "support"
      module like those you've seen throughout the course.</p>
    <p>The other major decision you need to make is how to separate the input
      processing from the table operations. The easiest method is to have a
      "driver" module that fully interprets the user's commands, and to put
      everything else in other modules.</p>
    <p>You can put the entire user input loop in one function. Alternatively,
      you can branch off into auxiliary functions after reading the first word
      on a line, which can potentially make the code easier to read by
      eliminating deep indentation (which you are supposed to do, according to
      the coding standard). Whatever you do, file input and table processing
      should not be in the same function as the user input loop.</p>
    <p>Access to the table can be problematic. The best practice is to construct
      the table as a local object, and pass it as a parameter to all other
      functions. However, if every function that operates on the table is in the
      same module, then you can potentially use a global variable in that
      module.</p>
    <h3>Input and Output</h3>
    <p>You will need to make an "ifstream" in order to read from the file. You
      can use "cin" for user input, "cout" for all reports, and "cerr" for error
      messages.</p>
    <p>You must have well formatted output. The user should never see a wall of
      text with no space. At the very least, you should insert a blank line
      after every block of output, and you can make it prettier at the very end.</p>
    <p>Try to make use of headings like these:</p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><code>***** Heading *****</code><br>
      <br>
      <code>----- Heading -----</code><br>
      <br>
      <code>Heading</code><br>
      <code>-------</code><br>
      <code></code></div>
    <p>If you use colons, you will usually want to put a blank line before and
      after.</p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><code>Heading:</code><code><br>
        <br>
      </code><code>-</code><code><br>
      </code><code>| <br>
        | Block</code><code><br>
        |<br>
      </code><code>-</code><code><br>
      </code><code><br>
      </code><code>Heading</code><code>:<br>
        <br>
      </code><code><code>-</code><code><br>
        </code><code>| <br>
          | Block</code><code><br>
          |<br>
        </code><code>-</code><code></code></code></div>
    <p>As usual, tables should be aligned with column headings, and lines should
      not exceed 80 characters. You know the drill.</p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> </div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"></p>
    <h3>Error Messages</h3>
    <p>As with last time, you should print error messages when operations fail.
      You must print enough information that the user will know what went wrong.
      Don't end the program unless there really is no alternative.</p>
    <p>See the project notes file regarding what assumptions you can make about
      the input format.</p>
    <h3>Attack Plan</h3>
    <p>I shouldn't need to tell you this at this point in the semester, but the
      most most critical commands to implement are INPUT and ALL. Don't worry
      about names containing whitespace or sorting the table -- just get it to
      read and print the simple test file.</p>
    <p>You can start from the top down (user input), or the bottom up
      (municipality class). Top-down is probably better, since you can test your
      user input logic without the table or a lot of extra test code. Add
      features one at a time once you have the basics working.</p>
    <h3>Testing</h3>
    <p>There is no test module to turn in this time, but it would still be wise
      to develop a series of test cases as you go, testing each new feature you
      add, and finally, error handling.</p>
