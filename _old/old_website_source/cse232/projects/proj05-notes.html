    <h2>Project 5 Extra Notes</h2>
    <h3>Program Design</h3>
    <p>You must break your program into multiple functions. The simplest
      organization for this project is to have "main" call several other
      functions in turn for each step of the processing. You can pass your data
      to each function as parameters. We highly discourage you from relying on
      global variables except for symbolic constants.</p>
    <p>Any duplicate code should also be moved to smaller auxiliary functions.</p>
    <h3>Symbolic Constants</h3>
    <p>You should not be hard-coding numbers in this project. It was okay in
      Project 3 only because each value was only used once and had little
      independent meaning.</p>
    <p>You can create global symbolic constants in two ways:</p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><code>// const</code><code>ant</code><code></code><br>
      <code>const TYPE NAME</code><code> = VALUE;</code><br>
      <br>
      <code>// macro</code><code></code><br>
      <code>#define NAME VALUE</code></div>
    <p>Technically, the second method results in slightly faster code, since the
      preprocessor literally substitutes the name with the text, with a result
      as if the numbers were hard-coded. But normal constants are also
      acceptable, and if you want to declare a constant for a single block, you
      should use them instead of macros.</p>
    <h3>File Organization</h3>
    <p>Here is the basic principle: you have one interface (.h) file for each
      source (.cpp) file <strong>that defines functions</strong><strong> called
        from outside </strong><strong>the file</strong>. Files that are not
      accessed by any other, such as the "driver" modules in most projects in
      this class, do not need an interface file (though there are reasons you
      might still use one).</p>
    <p>This project is just small enough that you can probably get away with one
      file. In this case, you can put all your declarations at the top of the
      file, followed by "main", then the rest of the function definitions.</p>
    <p>However, it would be a good idea to get used to designing multi-file
      programs. One good strategy is to put just "main" in your driver, and put
      your other functions in a "support" module.</p>
    <p>You almost certainly need to create a record for the data from one
      weather station. This results in a slightly weird situation: if you want
      to use the same record in multiple files, you need to declare it in an
      interface file and include that file in each source file that uses the
      record. If you write any functions that operate <strong>on a single
        record</strong>, those go in the corresponding source file. Otherwise,
      you don't need one.</p>
    <p>To be be clear:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>my_record.h -- contains the record declaration</li>
      <li>my_record.cpp -- contains functions that operate on a single record</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Functions that operate on a single record should not be combined with
      those that operate on an array of records. The former go in <em>my_record.cpp</em>,
      while the latter go in <em>support.cpp</em>.</p>
    <p><em>Note: In th</em><em>is project, </em><em>if you have no functi</em><em>ons
        that operate on a single record, you can go ahead and include the record
        declaration </em><em>in "</em><em>support.h</em><em>", </em><em>since
        we know the driver will include that header. But I still don't recommend
        this, since most of the time trying to reduce the number of files just
        creates problems.</em><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></p>
    <p>In summary, this is the largest set of files you should consider using
      for this project:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>driver.cpp</li>
      <li>support.cpp</li>
      <li>support.h</li>
      <li>my_record.cpp (substituted with the name of record)</li>
      <li>my_record.h (substituted with the name of record)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Finally, just a reminder that you should not have any #include-s in your
      interface file unless the contents of those interface file intself uses
      things from the included modules.</p>
    <h3>Incremental Development</h3>
    <p>The absolute first thing you should do after choosing a basic design and
      getting things set up is to get the program to read the file and print the
      table. Don't worry about the calculations until that works. If your input
      or table output crash or get in an infinite loop, the rest cannot be
      graded.</p>
    <h3>Output Formatting</h3>
    <p>You must use real table formatting this time. Remember (a) column
      headings, (b) appropriate length columns, and (c) keep the whole thing
      smaller than 80 characters in width. You can abbreviate headings if you
      need to. There are course pack examples, and my <a href="https://www.msu.edu/%7Ehanson54/cse232/examples/">output
        formatting example</a> shows all the syntax.</p>
    <h3>Error Checking</h3>
    <p>You will need extensive error checking that works according to the
      project spec's. Note that you must (a) print a specific and informative
      error message for each case and (b) stop execution if applicable.</p>
    <p>You can use "exit()" or "return" to halt, depending on your project
      design. In general you should not use "exit()" in libraries, because it
      prevents the user from choosing how to handle an error. But because this
      is an end user program, it's okay.</p>
    <h3>Compiler Warnings</h3>
    <p>Remember to always clean up all compiler warnings. If you get any, you
      are almost certainly doing something unsafe. You can add -Wall (all
      warnings) to each compilation command in your makefile to see all
      warnings.</p>
