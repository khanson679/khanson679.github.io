Some of the resources I made for MSU students in linguistics, Japanese, and computer science are listed below.

## [CSE 232 Section 1 Site]({{ site.baseurl }}/cse232)
For SS13, the last semester I was a TA.

## [Japanese Flashcards]({{ site.baseurl }}/jpn)
For Tobira (textbook) and JPN 401/402, for use with Anki (SRS flashcard software).

## [LaTeX and Tree Drawing Workshops]({{ site.baseurl }}/latex/workshops)
For LIN 434 (Intro to Syntax).

## [qUALMS Conlanging Workshop (FS13)]({{ site.baseurl }}/conlanging)
A first attempt at making a structured system for designing artificial (human) languages. We determined that 90 minutes wasn't long enough.
