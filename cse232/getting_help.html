    <h1>Getting Help</h1>
    <p>In general:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Email me or Mr. McCullen any time. We're both very accessible.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Come to office hours! You can come to Mr. McCullen's or any TA's
        consulting hours without prior notice. </li>
      <li>Get help sooner rather than later. Consulting hours get very busy
        right on the night a project is due, so you're more likely to get all
        the help you need if you come earlier in the week.</li>
      <li>Think twice before looking stuff up online. You should have all the
        programming knowledge you need for the labs and the projects from the
        lectures, examples, and textbook.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>During lab:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Try a few times on your own, ask a neighbor for help (lab assignments
        are collaborative), then call me over. Don't spend the entire time
        struggling on your own if you get stuck. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>For projects:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Before asking for help, make sure you have first:
        <ul>
          <li>read the notes file for the project </li>
          <li>studied the examples in the course pack </li>
          <li>reread your notes </li>
          <li>looked it up in the text book </li>
          <li>tried doing it another way </li>
          <li>checked for common bugs </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If you're still stuck, DO ask for help. There's not point wasting
        hours puzzling over an error when more often than not, we can give you a
        list of possible causes without a second thought. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you're struggling:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Contact me and/or Mr. McCullen as soon as you realize you're in
        trouble. Everything in this course is cumulative, so falling behind can
        quickly become disastrous. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Other problems or concerns:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Email me about lab assignments and grading questions/mistakes. Email
        Mr. McCullen first for most other problems, including missed project
        deadlines.</li>
    </ul>
