    <h2>Project 4 Extra Notes<br>
    </h2>
    <ol>
    </ol>
    <h3>Quick Hints and Reminders</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Do not copy the interface (.h) file into your account. You should use
        the path to the original in your code. Because the interface file will
        not change, you do not need to include it in your makefile.</li>
      <li>You absolutely cannot use operator== to compare against NAN
        (technically you can for INFINITY)</li>
      <li> Use &#8220;finite&#8221; as shown in the demo program to test for NAN and
        INFINITY</li>
      <li>To return NAN and INFINITY, write the names in all caps.</li>
      <li>You need to use symbolic constants (for PI, epsilon, etc.) either from
        the cmath library or created by yourself.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Incremental Development</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Some of the functions depend on other functions. Therefore, there is
        no point in writing the dependent functions until the functions they
        rely on are working.</li>
      <li>For some functions, it will be hard to handle all possible input
        values on your first attempt. For example, "modulo" must handle negative
        values, and in the same way that "fmod" from cmath does. First, get it
        to work just for positive values.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Testing Principles</h3>
    <ol>
    </ol>
    This is the first project with a &#8220;driver&#8221; module for testing. You will need
    many test cases for each function.<br>
    Test cases fall into two categories:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Error conditions (where output is undefined)</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The function needs to (a) not fail, and (b) return some specific
          error value (e.g. as defined by project specifications).</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Normal conditions</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The function needs to (a) not fail, and (b) return the correct
          result.</li>
        <li>You need to test various values throughout the range of valid
          values.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>ex. In functions with parameters of type "double", you must test
            large and small, positive and negative input.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>ex. In "sine" and "cosine", you need to test each values from each
            quadrant of the unit circle.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ol>
    <h3> Testing Modules ("Drivers")</h3>
    Absolutely required:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>You must label your output. It must be clear what the function, input,
        and output are.</li>
      <li>You must format it so that it is easy to read -- break the output into
        sections for each function\</li>
    </ol>
    <p>At the very minimum, you will need to do something like this for every
      test:</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><code>cout &lt;&lt; "fac</code><code>torial("
        &lt;&lt; </code><code>15 &lt;&lt; ") = " &lt;&lt; factorial(15)
        &lt;&lt; endl;</code></p>
    Recommended (for now):<br>
    <ol>
      <li>You should compare the output of your functions with output from the
        &#8220;cmath&#8221; library. Otherwise, you're just guessing that the results are
        correct.</li>
      <li>You can use "setw()" from "iomanip" to create columns. Note that you
        must use "setw()" before every field individually.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Testing Functions</h3>
    You will find it massively helpful to create auxiliary testing functions
    like this:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><code>void testFactorial(int x) {</code><code><br>
      </code><code>&nbsp; </code><code>cout &lt;&lt; "fac</code><code>torial("
        &lt;&lt; </code><code>x &lt;&lt; ") = " &lt;&lt; factorial(x) &lt;&lt;
        endl;<br>
        }<br>
      </code></div>
    <code></code><br>
    <code></code>Then, you can just call these auxiliary functions repeatedly in
    order to test your library functions, rather than<br>
    copying and pasting the whole output line.<br>
