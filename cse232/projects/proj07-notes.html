    <h2>Project 7 Extra Notes</h2>
    <h3> Implementation</h3>
    This one should be fairly easy. The main thing to remember as you write it
    is that we are NOT using the null byte ('\0') to mark the end of the array,
    but instead using "length" and "capacity" data members.<br>
    <h3>Testing</h3>
    <p>Testing this one will be much like project 6, but rather short. Remember
      to build your testing module as you go, with good labels and test cases
      right from the start.</p>
    <p>To test your constructor, print the values you are initializing the
      string to, then print the strings you created. You should also print the
      length and capacity to make sure they are correct.</p>
    <p>Then, all you really have left to test is operator==. To test that the
      destructor is deleting the array properly, you can run your program in
      Valgrind.</p>
    <p>Remember to test a variety of string sizes and contents.</p>
    <h3>Error Checking</h3>
    <p>The only thing you have to check this time is memory allocation. You can
      do this the same way as in the course pack (ex. 32) or lab 9, and print an
      error and exit in the same way as well.</p>
    <p>However, you should still avoid printing error messages elsewhere in
      container classes -- almost anywhere you think of putting one will be
      inappropriate. In general, it's better to throw exceptions or let other
      people's exceptions filter up. We'll return to error printing in our next
      end-user application.</p>
