    <h1 class="western">Course Advice</h1>
    <h2>Course Content</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Don't skip lecture. Everything you need to know is covered in
        lecture, and everything covered in lecture will be on the exams. Bring a
        laptop and work on your projects if you think you know it all.</li>
      <li> You may or may not need to read the textbook in detail. At a minimum,
        you should skim each assigned section after the corresponding lecture.
        If you find the the lectures alone are inadequate, then you should
        definitely read the textbook in detail for the alternate presentation. </li>
      <li>Come talk to us if you're interested in the more advanced topics that
        are hinted at, but not emphasized in this course (including C++
        features, data structures, compilation, operating systems, computer
        architecture, etc.). At the very least, we can give you some recommended
        reading.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Programming Projects<br>
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Start each project early, no later than the weekend before it is due.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>If you run into any problems, you want them to occur well before the
          night the project is due. Office hours on project due dates are
          usually extremely busy, and there won't be enough time for us ensure a
          response to email questions either.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Don't underestimate how long the projects will take. The first few
        should be easy (aside from figuring out C++), but the later ones are
        significantly more complex.</li>
      <li>Always read the "Notes" file for each project before starting. The
        specifications are usually very brief, but the notes will answer most of
        your questions.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Practice good <a href="software_dev_pointers.html">software
          development strategies</a>.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>DO NOT try to write all of the code in one go and then start testing
          and documenting. This method does not save any time, and does not
          yield good results.</li>
        <li>If you can't finish a project in time, it is infinitely better to
          have a portion of the code working, tested, and documented than to
          have all of it written and nothing working (see the grading policy for
          <a href="grading_policies.html#broken">broken projects</a>).</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Don't disregard aspects of programming such as coding style,
        documentation, error checking, output formatting, and testing. These are
        all included in the grading criteria (see <a href="grading_policies.html">Grading
          Policies</a>).<br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Test your code thoroughly. Writing the first version is only a
          quarter of the work, if that.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Code Organization</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Keep your files organized. Put all of your files for CSE 232 in one
        folder, with sub-folders for each lab and project. </li>
      <li> Keep multiple versions of your programs (each in a different folder)
        in case you need to go back to an earlier one.<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>
        Create a new branch whenever what you have is working and you're about
        to make a large change.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>From Python to C++</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Do be on the lookout for similarities and differences between the
        languages. For example, "while" loops in C++ and Python are essentially
        identical, but "for" loops are completely different. </li>
      <li> Don't get hung up on the differences. C++ has a much steeper learning
        curve than Python, but it's going to be easier since you already know
        (at least) one language, and most programming languages (so-called
        "imperative languages") are very similar in their basic structure and
        function. </li>
      <li>Don't "write it in Python first", or cling to any similar crutches.
        Outlining your algorithms is always a good idea, but do it in <em>
          pseudocode </em>(with no reference to language-specific features).<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Exams<br>
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Do the practice exams. They are all but identical to the real thing.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Misc.<br>
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Get help sooner rather than later. Everything in this course is
        cumulative, so falling behind quickly becomes fatal (see <a href="getting_help.html">Getting
          Help</a>).<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
