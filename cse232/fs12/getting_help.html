<h1>Getting Help</h1>


<p>In general:</p>

<ul><li>Email me or Mr. McCullen any time. We're both very accessible.<br>

	</li><li>Come to office hours! You can come to Mr. McCullen's or any
	TA's consulting hours without prior notice.
	</li><li>Get help sooner rather than later. Consulting hours get very
	busy right before a project is due, so you'll get more of our time
	if you com earlier in the week.
</li></ul>

<p>During lab:</p>

<ul><li>Try a few times on your own, ask a neighbor for help (lab
	assignments are collaborative), then call me over. Don't spend the
	entire time struggling on your own if you get stuck.
	</li><li>If you're completely lost and it's because you missed
	lecture, start by getting notes from a classmate and/or reading the
	relevant sections of the textbook, and have specific questions to
	ask me.
	</li><li>Think twice before looking stuff up online. You should have
	all the programming knowledge you need for the labs (and the
	projects) from lecture.
</li></ul>

<p>For projects:</p>

<ul><li>Before asking for help, make sure you have first:
	<ul><li>read the notes file for the project
		</li><li>studied the examples in the course pack
		</li><li>reread your notes
		</li><li>looked it up in the text book
		</li><li>tried doing it another way
		</li><li>checked for common bugs
	</li></ul>
	</li><li>If you're still stuck, DO ask for help. There's not point
	wasting hours puzzling over an error when more often than not, we
	can give you a list of possible causes without a second thought.
</li></ul>

<p>If you're struggling:</p>

<ul><li>See me or Mr. McCullen as soon as you realize you're in
	trouble. Everything in this course is cumulative, so falling behind
	can quickly become disastrous.
</li></ul>

<p>Other problems or concerns:</p>

<ul><li>Email me about lab assignments and grading
	questions/mistakes. Email Mr. McCullen first for most other
	problems, including missed project deadlines.</li></ul>
