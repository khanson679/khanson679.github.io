## Text Editors

Bracketed trees easiest to create and modify using a text editor. There are many good text editors out there. I recommend [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com), which is excellent, works on all major operating systems, and has an unlimited free trial.

If you don't like how Sublime Text inserts closing brackets automatically, go to Preferences -> Settings - User and insert the following line between the brackets in the settings file, then save and close:
-   "auto\_match\_enabled": false

Some other (free and open source) text editors include:

-   [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (Windows only, very good)
-   [Geany](http://www.geany.org) (Windows/Linux, similar to Notepad++)
-   [jEdit](http://jedit.org) (cross-platform, requires Java, annoying
    in some places)

Note that the built-in Windows editor, Notepad, lacks auto-indentation and other critical features and is thus nearly useless. TextEdit in OSX is more of a word processor than a text editor and is likewise not appropriate.
